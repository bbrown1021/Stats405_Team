# Stats 405 Team Project

## WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT

### Stuff to Add

- do we need to add a section going further into answering the question? not just a list of frequencies
  - maybe a pretty graph, like histogram
  - or more summary statistics

### Stuff to Discuss

- use xtable or ktable?
  - currently using ktable due to compilation issues
- he gives many examples in his NBA example that seem to prefer xtable outputs
