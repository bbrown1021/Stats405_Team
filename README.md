# Stats 405 Team Project

## WEEK 4 ASSIGNMENT

### Stuff to Fix

- background image, make opaque on first page
- gsub to fix Montreal Canadians team name
  - code from lecture might be helpful:
  - gsub("\xe9", "e", df_out[ , "VT" ])


### Stuff to Add

- do we need to add a section going further into answering the question? not just a list of frequencies
- maybe a pretty graph, like histogram

### Stuff to Discuss

- use xtable or ktable?
  - currently using ktable due to compilation issues
- he gives many examples in his NBA example that seem to prefer xtable outputs
